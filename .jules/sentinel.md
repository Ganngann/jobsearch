## 2026-05-17 - Fix Wildcard Injection in LIKE queries
**Vulnerability:** User input containing wildcard characters (%, _) was directly injected into SQL LIKE clauses, enabling a database Denial of Service attack by forcing wide scans.
**Learning:** Using backslashes ('\') to escape wildcards in Laravel's whereRaw is not cross-database compatible. SQLite interprets it correctly with an ESCAPE clause, but MySQL interprets the backslash as a string escape, breaking the query syntax.
**Prevention:** Use a database-agnostic escape character (like '=') in whereRaw (e.g., `whereRaw("column LIKE ? ESCAPE '='", ["%{$escaped}%"])`) and escape the user input with `str_replace(['=', '%', '_'], ['==', '=%', '=_'], $input)`.
